First reading must be an anomoly judging by the Lux readings,,,,,,
30 seconds intervals,,,,,,
Panel Voltage dropped as the sun cam around. Weird,,,,,,
Offset seemed to not do any damage,,,,,,
Sun quite low but hidden behind clouds.,,,,,,
Light between 311 and 371,,,,,,
,Panel voltage around 5.7,,,,,
